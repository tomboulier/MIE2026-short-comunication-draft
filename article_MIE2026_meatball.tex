\begin{abstract}
Despite strong evidence, implementing Patient Blood Management (PBM) in routine practice remains 
challenging. This work describes the method we used at Grenoble Alpes University Hospital for 
producing quality reports using data from a graph-based clinical data warehouse.

\section{Introduction}

Patient Blood Management (PBM) is an evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach to
optimize patient care and reduce unnecessary transfusion. 
It relies on three pillars: detection and correction of preoperative anemia, reduction 
of perioperative blood loss, and optimization of anemia tolerance. 
It has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing 
transfusions \cite{godonReductionRedBlood2024}, yet variability in adherence across 
departments persists and scaling implementation requires continuous monitoring and feedback.
This addresses a key challenge in health informatics: integrating information 
technology within real healthcare systems to support continuous quality improvement.

In France, the \textit{If-PBM} program was introduced to support the implementation of PBM 
through targeted funding.  One of its key requirements is to develop dashboards for monitoring 
adherence to PBM guidelines, providing funded centers with tools to track progress and identify areas
for improvement.

\section{Methods}

Five indicators were computed every three months: the proportion of standardized PBM preoperative check-ups,
 the proportion of corrective treatments for anemia or iron deficiency, the proportion of patients 
 transfused per- or postoperatively, the proportion of single-unit transfusion episodes, and the 
 proportion of patients discharged with low hemoglobin levels. Each indicator was calculated for 3 
 specific surgical specialties: orthopedics, cardiology, and gynecology. 

PBM indicators were computed quarterly from our graph-based clinical data warehouse \cite{Artemova2019}
using Talend-orchestrated Python pipelines linking patients, transfusions, lab tests, and surgical 
procedures.

\section{Results}

The PBM monitoring system has been operational since May 2023, with quarterly 
reports deployed across three surgical specialties. Over a two-year period, an 
average of 353 surgeries per quarter were analyzed (orthopedics: 170, 
cardiology: 132, gynecology: 75).

As an example, Figure~\ref{fig:pbm_trends} illustrates the temporal evolution of preoperative 
PBM assessment completion rates. Overall compliance increased from 40\% in May 
2023 to 80\% in February 2025. Orthopedics showed the fastest improvement, 
reaching 90\% by August 2023 from 30\% in May 2023, while gynecology remained under
60\% throughout the period.

\section{Discussion}

Integrating PBM indicators into a graph-based clinical data warehouse enables
 \textbf{automated quality monitoring} at hospital scale.

Our automated reports identified departments with strong adherence to specific practices 
(e.g., orthopedics for preoperative assessments) and those requiring improvement. 
These reports will serve as the primary objective outcome measure to evaluate the 
effectiveness of a micro-learning intervention targeting low-adherence specialties.

Future technical developments involve refactoring the current data stack with modern 
tools (\textbf{Dagster}, \textbf{dbt}, \textbf{OMOP}) as part of a regional clinical 
datawarehouse initiative. The objective is to replace semi-manual orchestration 
(Talend, Python scripts) with fully automated, web-accessible dashboards enabling 
real-time monitoring across the region.
