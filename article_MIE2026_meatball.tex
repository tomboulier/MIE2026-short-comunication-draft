\begin{abstract}
Patient Blood Management (PBM) is an evidence-based approach to optimize transfusion 
practices and patient outcomes. Despite strong guidelines, implementing PBM in routine 
practice remains challenging. This work describes the development of 
automated reports for monitoring adherence to PBM recommendations using the 
clinical data warehouse of Grenoble Alpes University Hospital. 
By leveraging a graph-based data model with ArangoDB, we implemented data pipelines
that process transfusion events, laboratory tests, and surgical procedures to generate 
quarterly PBM adherence indicators. Our approach enables automated quality monitoring 
at hospital scale and provides actionable feedback to clinical teams. Future 
developments include refactoring the current data stack with modern tools for regional
deployment and using these reports to evaluate the impact of a micro-learning program.

\section{Introduction}

Patient Blood Management (PBM) is an evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach to
optimize patient care and reduce unnecessary transfusion \cite{shander2022global}. 
It relies on three pillars: detection and correction of preoperative anemia, reduction 
of perioperative blood loss, and optimization of anemia tolerance. 
Despite strong national \cite{theissen2024perioperative} and international \cite{tibi2021sts} 
guidelines, implementing PBM in routine practice remains challenging \cite{godonReductionRedBlood2024}.

In France, the \textit{If-PBM} ("Incitation financière au PBM") program was introduced 
to support the implementation of PBM through targeted funding ("Article 51" experimentation). 
One of its key requirements is to develop dashboards for monitoring adherence to 
PBM guidelines, providing funded centers with tools to track progress and identify areas
for improvement.

This work describes the method we used at Grenoble Alpes University Hospital for 
producing PBM quality reports using data from a clinical data warehouse. 
This addresses a key challenge in health informatics: integrating information 
technology within real healthcare systems to support continuous quality improvement.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Data infrastructure}

The \textit{PREDIMED} platform (\textit{Plateforme de Recueil et d'Exploitation des Données bIoMédicales})
 is the clinical data warehouse of Grenoble Alpes University Hospital \cite{Artemova2019}. 
 It combines an ELT (Extract-Load-Transform) stack with \textbf{ArangoDB}, a multi-model graph database, 
 which enables semantic linkage between entities (patients, transfusions, laboratory tests, prescriptions, 
 hospital stays, surgical procedures, etc.).

\subsection{PBM indicators and data requirements}

Each PBM indicator requires combining several data sources across the three pillars:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Pillar 1:} Preoperative hemoglobin levels and iron status assessment
\item \textbf{Pillar 2:} Intraoperative blood loss estimation and transfusion timing
\item \textbf{Pillar 3:} Postoperative anemia tolerance thresholds
\end{itemize}

The graph model enables flexible traversal of relationships between transfused blood units and 
corresponding patient records, surgical procedures, and laboratory results. This approach differs 
from traditional relational models by allowing dynamic queries across heterogeneous medical entities 
without rigid schema constraints.

\subsection{Data pipeline architecture}

Data pipelines are orchestrated via \textbf{Talend} and \textbf{Python scripts}, producing aggregated 
metrics on a quarterly basis. The workflow includes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Extraction of relevant entities from the graph database (patients, transfusions, lab tests, surgical procedures);
\item Linkage of entities through graph traversal queries;
\item Computation of compliance metrics for each PBM recommendation;
\item Generation of temporal trends charts.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Results}

The PBM monitoring system has been operational since early 2024, with quarterly reports updates sent 
to anesthesiologist physicians in concerned surgical departments. 

Key deployment metrics include:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Coverage:} All surgical units (general surgery, urology, orthopedics, cardiac surgery)
\item \textbf{Frequency:} Quarterly updates with retrospective 3-month analysis
\item \textbf{Data volume:} Processing of thousands of transfusion events and laboratory results per quarter
\end{itemize}

Example indicators tracked in the dashboards include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Proportion of transfusions respecting recommended hemoglobin thresholds
\item Rate of preoperative anemia screening and correction
\item Temporal trends per department and surgical specialty
\item Compliance with intraoperative blood conservation strategies
\end{itemize}

Preliminary analyses reveal significant variations between departments and an overall improvement 
trend in PBM compliance over time. The visual dashboards provide actionable feedback, enabling clinical 
teams to identify specific areas requiring intervention.

\section{Discussion}

Integrating PBM indicators into a graph-based clinical data warehouse enables automated quality monitoring at 
hospital scale. Future developments involves a refactoring of the current data stack with modern tools (Dagster, dbt, OMOP), 
in a region-wide initiative called D2H. The objective is to generalize real-time PBM monitoring and 
support adaptive interventions (such as micro-learning).
