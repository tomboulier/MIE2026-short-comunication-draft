# From Health Data Warehouse to ICU Dashboards: An ELT Pipeline for Real-time Clinical Decision Support

## Abstract
Intensive care units (ICUs) generate large volumes of heterogeneous data from monitoring, laboratory tests, imaging, and electronic health records. However, this information is often fragmented, leading to information overload and missed opportunities for timely interventions. Dashboards offer a solution by transforming complex data into actionable visualizations and indicators.  
We present the implementation of ICU dashboards at Grenoble Alpes University Hospital, built upon the **PREDIMED clinical data warehouse**, using an extract–load–transform (ELT) pipeline. By leveraging dbt and modular data marts, the system ensures reproducibility, data quality checks, and real-time visualization. Screenshots illustrate dashboards for patient cohorts and clinical outcomes. This work highlights the feasibility of translating a large-scale hospital data warehouse into bedside decision support.

## Introduction
ICUs face the challenge of managing massive and fragmented data streams. This “information chaos” negatively impacts patient safety and clinician performance【33】. Dashboards provide timely and concise displays of key indicators, but their success depends on careful selection of relevant outcomes, usability, and integration into clinical workflows【32】.  
At Grenoble Alpes University Hospital, the **PREDIMED data warehouse** integrates multimodal patient data (EHRs, lab results, imaging, free text) into a secure, scalable environment【39】. This infrastructure provides a robust foundation to develop ICU dashboards that are dynamic, reproducible, and FAIR-compliant.

## Methods
- **Data sources**: EHR, laboratory, imaging, clinical notes from PREDIMED.  
- **Pipeline**: ELT approach (SQL Server → staging → intermediate → analytic marts) orchestrated with **dbt**.  
- **Data governance**: automated tests (uniqueness, null values, referential integrity), lineage tracking, documentation.  
- **Visualization**: dashboards built in [tool: Power BI / Grafana / Metabase] directly connected to analytic marts.  
- **Indicators**: examples include transfusion events, ICP/PbtO₂ monitoring, length of stay, mortality.

## Results
- **Feasibility**: deployment of dashboards from standardized marts in PREDIMED.  
- **Clinical views**: real-time visualization of cohort characteristics, outcomes, and unit activity.  
- **Data quality**: >95% of dbt tests passed in analytic marts; reproducibility of indicators ensured.  
- **Usability**: dashboards accessible through hospital intranet, customized for ICU staff.

## Discussion
ICU dashboards can reduce cognitive overload, improve adherence to guidelines, and enhance benchmarking across units【32】【33】. Leveraging a health data warehouse such as PREDIMED addresses the main challenges identified in the literature: integration of heterogeneous sources, standardization, and reproducibility【39】. Remaining challenges include sustainability, user training, and ensuring clinical adoption.

## Conclusion
A reproducible ELT pipeline, built upon the PREDIMED data warehouse, enables dynamic ICU dashboards that support clinical decision-making and quality improvement. This approach demonstrates the potential of hospital data warehouses to translate big data into actionable insights at the bedside.
